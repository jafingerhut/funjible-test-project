# funjible-test-project

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

## Sample interaction

```clojure
(require '[funjible-test-project.core :as c])
(c/foo0 1)
(require '[funjible-test-project.foo1 :as foo1])
(foo1/foo1 5)
(require '[clojure.data :as d])
(d/diff #{1 3 5} #{2 3})
(require '[funjible-test-project.set :as s])
(c/foo0 1)
(foo1/foo1 5)
(d/diff #{1 3 5} #{2 3})
(require '[clojure.set :as cset])
(cset/difference #{5 7} #{3 5})
(cset/difference #{5 7})
(cset/difference #{5 7} #{3 5} #{1 2})
(doc cset/difference)
(source cset/difference)
(pprint (meta #'clojure.set/difference))
```


Output from sample interaction, interspersed with a few notes in
comments.

```clojure

;; The namespace funjible-test-project.set has not been loaded yet,
;; and will not be until it is explicitly require'd below.  Until
;; then, clojure.set/difference has its original value.

user=> (require '[funjible-test-project.core :as c])
nil
user=> (c/foo0 1)

;; As a side effect of this require, not only does the function
;; funjible-test-project.set/difference become defined, but the value
;; of that function is used to replace the original definition of
;; clojure.set/difference.

user=> (require '[funjible-test-project.set :as s])

;; Thus, this same function call as above now behaves differently.

;; clojure.data/diff calls clojure.set/difference when it is used to
;; compare sets that are different from each other.  Note that the new
;; version of clojure.set/difference is _not_ being used here, which
;; we can tell because there is no output about which version of
;; funjible-test-project.set/difference is being called.  This is
;; because Clojure is compiled with direct linking enabled, so
;; changing the value of the var #'clojure.set/difference has no
;; effect on which function clojure.data/diff calls.

user=> (d/diff #{1 3 5} #{2 3})
[#{1 5} #{2} #{3}]

;; Even if we now require clojure.set and call clojure.set/difference,
